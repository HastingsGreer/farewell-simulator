Gameplay:
-------------
You play as the host of a fancy party.  As your guests trickle out the following morning, you must wave goodbye to them.  Your guests don't want to be rude; any time you wave, they will wave back.  Help them get safely across the road by waving goodbye to prevent danger.

Input: Wave by wiggling the mouse.
